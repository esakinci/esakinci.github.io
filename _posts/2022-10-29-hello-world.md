Welcome to my page! 

In a world dominated by social media built and regulated by companies that can change or goes bankrupt; I have decided to share my thoughts and experience on my web page. 

I am aware of this kind of endeavor will be more demanding in terms of writing, editing, and management. Yet I doubt anybody will see or share any content this page provides. I donâ€™t know how far or what way this will go. But I plan to improve myself in terms of writing and sharing experiences. And become helpful to others by doing so.

Also, I want to give my thanks to my friend [Mustafa](https://dinler.dev/). Who gave me his advice and support to build this page by myself.
