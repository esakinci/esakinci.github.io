I want to share with you some of my music discovery highlights trough 5-6 years. Since this is my first post about this kind of content, the list has plenty items from various genres.

#### [She Past Away](https://youtu.be/6DM_MnNgZkc)
One of my latest discoveries and the most listened band while I work these days. It is a shame that I've discovered them so late since they are Turkish! This is a post-punk band with dark vibes. Their music is special for me since I've met and liked this genre thanks to them. Their music is exactly as they state "It is driving, it is mesmerizing. It is a haunt."
#### [Altın Gün](https://youtu.be/-UoDUl5HC18)
Another great Turkish band but this time with 70's Turkish rock style! I have to confess that I am an outsider to Turkish mainstream music knowledge. Yet I greatly respect this band. They have pure love for this culture and sound. And they execute their work flawlessly! 
#### [Haken](https://youtu.be/XNT_9mmQaS8)
When I first discovered [Opeth](https://youtu.be/54O-jvjamvo) back then, I instantly fell in love with progressive-metal genre. Since then I've listened bunch of different bands but this band shook my ears again and revived my excitement for this genre!
#### [Polyphia](https://youtu.be/Z5NoQg8LdDk)
WOW! Accumulation of talents and genre background in this band is crazy! The first song I listened to from them was "Playing God". Spanish guitar, dubstep, rock, and electronic all in one place! I was speechless.
#### [All Them Witches](https://youtu.be/8HEe1iT3oHo)
Be warned that this band may make you want to use some illegal substances! They are energetic, psychedelic and chill band in hard rock genre. Sometimes I lose track of time as I listen their songs. So I listen to them when I want to let my time peacefully go away.
#### [Alex Skonlnick Trio](https://youtu.be/hWlhxZMldM0)
I've found out that my high school years favorite band [Testament's](https://youtu.be/8YT8XX-640w) guitarist had a side job! He has this beautiful band that makes great jazz music.
#### [Kiko Loureiro](https://youtu.be/d8waigTCNhM)
From another great band [Megadeth](https://youtu.be/n9QqkcDRYFw), another great guitarist! Beautiful shreds and techniques come out from his fingers! 
#### [Scandroid](https://youtu.be/DoCasZ3HrRo)
A brilliant composer who produces new retro wave music. I've listened to his work heavily when I need to focus during my long coding sessions. It is easier for me to get my flow state while listening to electronic music.
#### [Perturbator](https://youtu.be/aqRGb8JkO38)
When I want something close to Scandroid but with darker and aggressive sounds, I choose Perturbator to listen. <br><br>

Human talent and creativity in music is truly amazing! Years and years come, and there are lots of bands and many music tastes to discover. Music definately makes life worth living for more. I hope that these kinds of discoveries keeps happening time to time..
