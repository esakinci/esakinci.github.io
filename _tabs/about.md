I've created this page for sharing my thoughts and things I like. There is a commenting feature enabled in some content shared here. Please feel free to share your thoughts or bits of advice about the content unless you are rude to others and the author. At least, try to be constructive if you oppose or critisize the content. 
I will appreciate your comment if it expands my awareness on my ignorance involving any subject. Any inappropriate comments that donâ€™t follow this rule will be removed. 

Also, here you may see posts in different languages. If my post is realated heavily on my native or national topics, it will be written in Turkish language. Otherwise I will try to write in English language as much as I can.
